# Memory-Allocation-Project
The access nature of main memory allows us to be more flexible when allocating processes. Many processes are usually always stored on the same main memory. The key issue is determining how much memory space should be allocated to these processes. Processes may be accessed quickly and effectively. There are three major memory techniques. The methods  "First Fit," "Best Fit," and "Worst Fit" are commonly used. Each approach has its own set of benefits as well as drawbacks. Although some systems support all three methods, but it is more common for a system to support only one.
